          <p class="section scrollspy" id="issue">Political prison camps are the source of some of the greatest atrocities committed in North Korea. They have lasted five times as long as the Nazi concentration camps and twice as long as the Soviet Gulags that inspired their creation. Their purpose is to detain (in most cases, for life) citizens who have committed “political crimes”—actions contradictory to the government’s wishes, but generally not considered criminal elsewhere in the world.</p>

          <p>An estimated 80,000 to 120,000 people are currently being detained in the four large prison camps known to exist in North Korea today. The North Korean regime refuses to acknowledge the existence of these camps and it is likely that there are additional, so far undetected secret detention facilities, where political prisoners are detained under similar conditions.</p>

        <div class="col s12 m4">
          <h4 class="center-align ebony-clay-text">Political crimes</h4>
          <p>“Political crimes” vary widely and can include acts as simple as listening to a South Korean pop song, attempting to make a phone call outside of the country, creasing the picture of a North Korean leader or otherwise doing anything to insult the authority of the leadership.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col s12 m4">
          <h4 class="center-align ebony-clay-text">Three generations</h4>
          <p>North Korea holds to a policy for some political “crimes” of punishing not only the “criminal,” but also up to three generations of the individual’s family, who may all be detained indefinitely or killed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col s12 m4">
          <h4 class="center-align ebony-clay-text">How do we know?</h4>
          <p>We now have testimonies from several former prisoners from different camps, as well as former guards who have defected. The validity of the evidence provided by these people is supported by how much these testimonies corroborate each other, and also because they have been corroborated by satellite images of the camps.</p>

            <h4 class="center-align ebony-clay-text">Testimonials</h4>
            <p>Mr Shin Dong-hyuk was born in Political Prison Camp No. 14 in 1981, as a result of a relationship the guards had arranged between his parents, who had no choice in the matter. His father and his family had apparently been imprisoned in the camp, because one of Mr Shin’s uncles had fled to the Republic of Korea. Mr Shin never found out why his mother was in the camp. Mr Shin described how he had been indoctrinated to internalize the guilt by family association principle that he never questioned the basis and conditions of his imprisonment:</p>

            <p>“I was born a criminal and I would die a criminal that was my fate … Where I lived only two kinds of people existed, the guards who had guns and the people who are inmates wearing uniforms. Inmates were born inmates, so we lived like inmates; that was our fate... Nobody taught us that way but that was all that we could see… so that’s how we lived.”</p>
