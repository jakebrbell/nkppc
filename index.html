          <p class="scrollspy" id="issue">Political prison camps are the source of some of the greatest atrocities committed in North Korea. They have lasted five times as long as the Nazi concentration camps and twice as long as the Soviet Gulags that inspired their creation. Their purpose is to detain (in most cases, for life) citizens who have committed “political crimes”—actions contradictory to the government’s wishes, but generally not considered criminal elsewhere in the world.</p>

          <p>An estimated 80,000 to 120,000 people are currently being detained in the four large prison camps known to exist in North Korea today. The North Korean regime refuses to acknowledge the existence of these camps and it is likely that there are additional, so far undetected secret detention facilities, where political prisoners are detained under similar conditions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col s12 m4">
          <h4 class="center-align mine-shaft-text">Political crimes</h4>
          <p>“Political crimes” vary widely and can include acts as simple as listening to a South Korean pop song, attempting to make a phone call outside of the country, creasing the picture of a North Korean leader or otherwise doing anything to insult the authority of the leadership.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col s12 m4">
          <h4 class="center-align mine-shaft-text">Three generations</h4>
          <p>North Korea holds to a policy for some political “crimes” of punishing not only the “criminal,” but also up to three generations of the individual’s family, who may all be detained indefinitely or killed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col s12 m4">
          <h4 class="center-align mine-shaft-text">The witnesses</h4>
          <p>We now have testimonies from several former prisoners from different camps, as well as former guards who have defected. The validity of the evidence provided by these people is supported by how much these testimonies corroborate each other, and also because they have been corroborated by satellite images of the camps.</p>

          <p class="scrollspy" id="report">The information for this site comes primarily from the UN commission of inquiry on human rights in North Korea. The commission was established in March 2013 by the UN Human Rights Council. More than 80 witnesses and experts testified publicly before the commission and provided information. Additionally, the commission conducted more than 240 confidential interviews with victims and other witnesses.</p>
          <p>The commission was mandated to investigate the systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights in North Korea including, in particular, the following nine specific areas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Violations of the right to food</li>
            <li>Violations associated with prison camps</li>
            <li>Torture and inhuman treatment</li>
            <li>Arbitrary arrest and detention</li>
            <li>The systemic violation of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms</li>
            <li>Violations of the freedom of expression</li>
            <li>Violations of the right to life</li>
            <li>Violations of the freedom of movement</li>
            <li>Abductions of nationals of other States</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The commission found that "systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations have been and are being committed" by North Korea. In many instances, the violations found entailed crimes against humanity. These crimes against humanity entail extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation.</p>
          <p>The commission estimated that hundreds of thousands of political prisoners have perished in these political prison camps over the past five decades. According to the commission, "the unspeakable atrocities that are being committed against inmates of the political prison camps resemble the horrors of camps that totalitarian States established during the twentieth century."</p>
