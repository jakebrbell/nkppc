          <p class="scrollspy" id="issue">Political prison camps are the source of some of the greatest atrocities committed in North Korea. They have lasted five times as long as the Nazi concentration camps and twice as long as the Soviet Gulags that inspired their creation. Their purpose is to detain (in most cases, for life) citizens who have committed “political crimes”—actions contradictory to the government’s wishes, but generally not considered criminal elsewhere in the world.</p>

          <p>An estimated 80,000 to 120,000 people are currently being detained in the four large prison camps known to exist in North Korea today. The North Korean regime refuses to acknowledge the existence of these camps and it is likely that there are additional, so far undetected secret detention facilities, where political prisoners are detained under similar conditions.</p>

        <div class="col s12 m4">
          <h4 class="center-align ebony-clay-text">Political crimes</h4>
          <p>“Political crimes” vary widely and can include acts as simple as listening to a South Korean pop song, attempting to make a phone call outside of the country, creasing the picture of a North Korean leader or otherwise doing anything to insult the authority of the leadership.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col s12 m4">
          <h4 class="center-align ebony-clay-text">Three generations</h4>
          <p>North Korea holds to a policy for some political “crimes” of punishing not only the “criminal,” but also up to three generations of the individual’s family, who may all be detained indefinitely or killed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col s12 m4">
          <h4 class="center-align ebony-clay-text">How do we know?</h4>
          <p>We now have testimonies from several former prisoners from different camps, as well as former guards who have defected. The validity of the evidence provided by these people is supported by how much these testimonies corroborate each other, and also because they have been corroborated by satellite images of the camps.</p>

              <p>Mr Shin Dong-hyuk was born in Political Prison Camp No. 14 in 1981, as a result of a relationship the guards had arranged between his parents, who had no choice in the matter. His father and his family had apparently been imprisoned in the camp, because one of Mr Shin’s uncles had fled to the Republic of Korea. Mr Shin never found out why his mother was in the camp. Mr Shin described how he had been indoctrinated to internalize the guilt by family association principle that he never questioned the basis and conditions of his imprisonment:</p>

              <p>“I was born a criminal and I would die a criminal that was my fate … Where I lived only two kinds of people existed, the guards who had guns and the people who are inmates wearing uniforms. Inmates were born inmates, so we lived like inmates; that was our fate... Nobody taught us that way but that was all that we could see… so that’s how we lived.”</p>

        <div class="col s12 flow-text">
          <h2 class="center-align ebony-clay-text">The Report</h2>
          <p class="scrollspy" id="report">In March 2013, the UN Human Rights Council established the commission of inquiry on human rights in North Korea. More than 80 witnesses and experts testified publicly before the commission and provided information. Additionally, the commission conducted more than 240 confidential interviews with victims and other witnesses.</p>

          <p>The commission was mandated to investigate the systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea including, in particular, the following nine specific substantive areas:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Violations of the right to food</li>
            <li>Violations associated with prison camps</li>
            <li>Torture and inhuman treatment</li>
            <li>Arbitrary arrest and detention</li>
            <li>The systemic denial and violation of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms</li>
            <li>Violations of the freedom of expression</li>
            <li>Violations of the right to life</li>
            <li>Violations of the freedom of movement</li>
            <li>Enforced disappearances in the form of abductions of nationals of other States</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The commission found that "systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations have been and are being committed" by North Korea. In many instances, the violations found entailed crimes against humanity. These crimes against humanity entail extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation.</p>

          <p>The commission estimated that hundreds of thousands of political prisoners have perished in these political prison camps over the past five decades. According to the commission, "the unspeakable atrocities that are being committed against inmates of the political prison camps resemble the horrors of camps that totalitarian States established during the twentieth century."</p>
